To the future publicity officer:

Congratulation, You have chosen the best job in the world!


This is a basic instruction for you as a website maintainer, in order to reduce your work.

Every year, the website needs updating. Now, the code is written in php and a bit of js, which might be complicated (or not) for you, depending on your background knowledge for programming.

You don't need to change most of the codes, however, you do need to edit data inside (i.e. committee members).

I am going to list some key points so you won't forget to edit them. And I am assuming that you might not be familiar with programming

1. committee.php
- Update all the committee members.
To make it look authentic, you should use the identical dimensions for the images (although php tries to adjust by itself, it will only adjust the row, and the ratio to the 
column will remain the same as the original image source).
- update the current year in the title and the heading.

2. crew.php
- update the current year in the title and the heading.

3. events.php
- update the event told by your president. The first event should always be fresher's fair

4. members.php
- update the link to the union page if its broken. (shouldn't be)

5. classes.php
- The calendar here is synced to a google calendar, and the source can be specified.
If you go to google calendar, choose "share calendar" and go to "Embed This Calendar" and copy what ever is in the text box (starting with <iframeâ€¦.>). ONLY REPLACE THE URL. Otherwise you can specify the dimension of the calendar as you wish.

If you want to include more than one calendar, click "Edit colour, size and others" which is on top of the textBox which you previously copied from, and you can customise ur calendar however you like.
