Aside from the amazing MS paint to help you do your dirty work. There exist 
some other picture editing software to help you on your journey. The two most
popular would be
<ul> 
<li> Photoshop </li>
<li> Gimp </li>

Photoshop costs money. If you haven't got some questionable version of Photoshop
then I highly suggest <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> as a photo editing
tool. There are a variety of online tutorials for using these programs and are
just one "googling" away. Youtube also has many tutorials, they are short and
helpful and can get your idea across quickly.

If you're going to do a quick crop job and stick some text onto that meme, then
some of the better sites I've seen include:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://wigflip.com/roflbot/"> roflbot </a></li>
<li> <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator"> Imgflip </a></li>
</ul>

There are also sites you can reference to to see what types of meme there are
available, such as:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://memegenerator.net/"> Meme generator </a></li>
<li> <a href="http://memesly.com/characters/popular/alltime"> Memesly </a></li>
