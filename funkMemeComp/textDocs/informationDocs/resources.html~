<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Aside from the amazing MS paint to do your dirty work. There exist 
other editing softwares to help you on your journey. The two most popular would be:</p>
<ul> 
<li> Photoshop </li>
<li> Gimp </li>
</ul>

<p>Photoshop costs money. If you haven't got some questionable version of Photoshop
then I highly suggest <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> as a photo editing
tool. There are a variety of online tutorials which are just a Google away. Youtube also has many 
tutorials, they are usually short and helpful.</p>

<h3>Captioning pictures</h3>

<p>If you're going to do a quick crop job and stick some text onto that meme, then some of the 
better sites I've seen include:</p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator" target="new"> Imgflip </a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also sites you can reference to to see examples of actual memes such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://memegenerator.net/" target="new"> Meme generator </a></li>
<li> <a href="http://memesly.com/characters/popular/alltime" target="new"> Memesly </a></li>
