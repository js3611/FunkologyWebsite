<h3>Welcome to the FuNkoLoGy meme competition!</h3>
<p>The competition is open to all members and even to the graduates! I hope you all can help 
contribute to the competition and join us making hilarious,
embarassing pics of our current crew! Don't worry about making a "good" or
"professional" picture, if it's funny, we'll consider it!</p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>We hope that the result of this competition is the creation of our own meme booklet. In here we 
will immortalise the best memes created to gaze back on in the future. In addition we shall place 
some memes onn <a href="https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/funkology/">our website</a>.

<h4>Competition format</h4>
<p>The competition moderators will collect entries into our secret funky database. 
We will then shortlist the entries and possibly ask for your help to judge them(#noDictatorship). 
</p>

<p id="stageStatement">This is now the initial creation stage 
where we ask you to participate in the competition!</p>
